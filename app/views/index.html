  Pakyow is an open-source platform for the modern web. Build web-based apps faster with a view-first development process that's friendly to everyone &ndash; whether you're a designer or a developer. It's for getting along.
</p>

<h1>
  Pakyow lets you start with a view and build the app on top. Here's how it works:
</h1>

<div class="container-3 fluid blurbs">
  <div class="col">
    <p>
      Generate your app and immediately create views using HTML or your favorite template language.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col">
    <p>
      Start the app and see the views in your local browser without adding any back-end code.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col">
    <p>
      Add back-end code without changing any of the previously created views.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="moving">
  This process gets you right to work, reducing friction to keep your project moving forward.
