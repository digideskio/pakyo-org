title: 0.7.1 Release
time: 8:55am CST

Announcing Pakyow 0.7.1, available now on Rubygems. This minor release fixes a
few issues discovered since the last release and also adds a few small features
to core and presenter.

## Rubinius Support

This release brings support for Rubinius (tested in 1.2.4 and 2.0-dev). A
special thank you to the great people on the #rubinius channel for helping us
solve a few issues. You were a huge help!

## Misc Presenter Changes

A binder can now be defined for multiple labels. It's as simple as passing
multiple arguments to the binder_for method:

```ruby
class MyBinder < Pakyow::Presenter::Binder
  binder_for :this, :that
end
```

The in_context method now passes the current context as a parameter to the
block. This allows you to (optionally) keep up with multiple contexts and is
useful when using nested contexts:

```ruby
view.find('#foo').in_context { |foo_context|
  foo_context.find('#bar').in_context {
    puts "Bar context: #{context}"
    puts "Foo context: #{foo_context}"
  }
}
```

## Application Generation Changes

The config.ru rackup file has been fixed so that it uses the builder created by
Pakyow. It wasn't before and, as a result, middleware was not being loaded.
Since this change is only effective for applications generated from this point
on, we recommend changing your rackup file manually. Here's the new version:

```ruby
require File.expand_path('../config/application', __FILE__)
PakyowApplication::Application.builder.run(PakyowApplication::Application.stage(ENV['RACK_ENV']))
run PakyowApplication::Application.builder.to_app
```

We also fixed the rakefile so that it can be run for a specific environment and
accept additional arguments. Again, we recommend changing your rakefile in
existing apps:

```ruby
require File.expand_path('../config/application', __FILE__)
PakyowApplication::Application.stage(ENV['ENV'])
```

## Bug Fixes

Several bug fixes are included in this release:

- Fixed issue running with ignore_routes turned on. This was broken for some use cases.
- Fixed view caching to work under all scenarios.
- Fixed View#content= method to allow setting content to nil.
- Fixed Views#find method.
- Binder#action now adds a leading slash to the path if necessary.
