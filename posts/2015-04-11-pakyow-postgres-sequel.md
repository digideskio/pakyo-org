Yesterday [@bryanp](http://twitter.com/bryanp) published an article on connecting a Pakyow app to Postgres using Sequel:

> Pakyow doesn't ship with an ORM (object-relational mapper) layer. This reflects a design decision we made early on to be unopinionated about such things. Instead, we let the user choose the ORM that they're most comfortable with. There are some good options out there, including Sequel, ROM, and ActiveRecord.

> The ORM we use most often at Metabahn is Sequel. It's stable, performant, and stays out of our way. Today I'd like to show how we've integrated Sequel into the dozens of Pakyow apps we've shipped to production over the last couple of years. Postgres is our database of choice in most cases, so we'll be talking specifically about that here.
