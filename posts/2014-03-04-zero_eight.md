title: "Pakyow 0.8: New Router, Updated View Syntax, and Smarter View Transformation"
time: 7:45am CST
---

It's been 2 years since the last significant Pakyow release. Today I am very
excited to announce that the next version, 0.8 has been officially released.
It's been a long time coming.

Since the last release we've been thinking, coding, and rewriting nearly every
aspect of Pakyow. From the beginning we've wanted to build a framework that is
easy for beginners, has great performance characteristics, and enables a process
that's friendly to both designers and developers.

Happily, 0.8 is a huge step forward.

In addition to a fresh new release, we have a [new site](http://pakyow.com),
[better docs](http://pakyow.com/docs), and a [warmup](http://pakyow.com/warmup)
that will help you build and deploy your first Pakyow app.

Rather than review every change, I'd like to walk through three of the biggest
0.8 changes.

## New Router

The router has been rewritten to include advanced features like grouping,
namespacing, and route mixins and templates. Here's an example using the new
built-in restful route template:

```ruby
restful :post, '/posts' do
  list do
    # code here
  end

  # other restful methods here

  collection do
    get 'collection_example'; end
  end

  member do
    get 'member_example'; end
  end
end
```

This creates the following routes:

- GET '/posts'
- GET '/posts/collection_example'
- GET '/posts/:post_id/member_example'

But this only scratches the surface. Read up on the new router
[here](http://pakyow.com/docs/routing).

## Updated View Syntax

Views are still composed in 0.8. But we've made the view layer more powerful and
easier to use by creating distinctions between the different parts of a view.

1. Templates
2. Pages
3. Partials

A template defines the general structure for a view and one or more containers:

```html
<body>
  <!-- @container my_container -->
</body>
```

Pages implement a template and define content for its containers:

```html
---
template: my_template
---

<!-- @within my_container -->
  content for my_container

  <!-- @include a_partial -->
<!-- /within -->
```

Notice the `@include`? That's including a partial into the page. Composed
together, the resulting view looks like this:

```html
<body>
  content for my_container

  (content from a_partial)
</body>
```

## Smarter View Transformation

One of the fundamental concepts in Pakyow has been that the front-end and
back-end of an application are developed in isolation. This leads to logic-less
views and isolates the back-end code. The problem is that we didn't fully
accomplish this in previous releases.

In 0.7, the back-end code used CSS selectors to address the part of a view it
wanted to manipulate. This *created* a connection between back-end code and the
view that led to brittle apps (what if the view structure changed?). As of 0.8,
everything in the view is hidden to the back-end except for what is explicitly
exposed.

Here's a view transformation example in 0.8.

The view:

```html
<div data-scope="post">
  <h1 data-prop="title">
    Title goes here
  </h1>
</div>
```

Back-end code:

```ruby
view.scope(:post).apply([
  { title: 'Ima Post' },
  { title: 'Post 2' }
])
```

Resulting view:

```html
<div data-scope="post">
  <h1 data-prop="title">
    Ima Post
  </h1>
</div>

<div data-scope="post">
  <h1 data-prop="title">
    Post 2
  </h1>
</div>
```

As you can see, back-end code is now expressed in terms of *data* rather than a
*view-specific language*. This allows the view structure to evolve independently
of the back-end, making it possible to perform front-end refactors without
changing any back-end code (so long as the same data model is represented).

[here](http://pakyow.com/docs/data_binding).

## What's Next?

0.8 is the most stable release yet. There should not be any major changes to the
public API between 0.8 and 1.0. So, we hope to be on a more frequent release
cycle from this point forward. At the same time, we plan to put out more content
to help you learn and use Pakyow.

We are planning for one more major release before 1.0. A full roadmap will be
published in the coming weeks, but our efforts will be focused in two main
areas:

- A new pakyow-ui library for building auto-updating views
- Better integration with other Ruby web frameworks

This is an exciting release and we hope you enjoy it. As always, feel free to
join the conversation here, on the [mailing
list](http://groups.google.com/group/pakyow), or find us on
