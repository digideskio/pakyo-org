title: "Pakyow v0.9 Release Party"
time: 7:21am CST
---

On December 11th, [Metabahn](http://metabahn.com) hosted a release party for the
Pakyow v0.9 release. We had over 20 attendees from the area and much fun was
had! There were several requests for a live stream, which we plan to have for
the next event. Below you'll find an overview of what was discussed, along with
videos of the event.

## Backend-Driven, Realtime UIs

The v0.10 release will include three new libraries for building realtime apps
that are driven completely by back-end Ruby code. This means that any Pakyow
view can reflect changes in app state in realtime, without writing a single line
of Javascript. **This is big.** 

We'll have much more to say on this soon. Until then, check out the live coding
demo below.

## Ringside, Launching This Month

We're launching a new service, called [Ringside](http://ringside.io). Ringside
is a coaching service to help you build and ship your web-based apps. A free
private beta will be available later this month.

The entire event was recorded and edited into shorter videos for each topic. If
you'd like to watch all the footage at once, you can find that video at the
bottom of the page.

Enjoy!
