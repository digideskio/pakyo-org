Pakyow v0.9.1 was pushed out moments ago with several bug fixes for `pakyow-presenter`:

- Name attributes weren't being set on form fields in all cases.
- The built-in form action binding caused Presenter to occasionally explode.
- Composer wasn't handling partials properly, causing erratic behavior with view manipulation.

Happy Saturday!
